# Welcome to VIPR AI Assistant! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to have you on board. As your AI Assistant, I'll guide you through the essential aspects of your simulation and computation experiments."

# How I Can Help
As your AI assistant, I'm here to support you with:

- **Code Interpretation:** Provide explanations and clarifications on the structure and functions within the source code file.
- **Customization Guidance:** Offer insights into how to modify parameters to meet specific requirements for your experiment.
- **Error Resolution:** Help troubleshoot errors in your script or setup.
- **Enhancement Suggestions:** Recommend possible improvements or optimizations to the current algorithm.
- **Additional Research:** Assist in finding external references or additional information regarding scattering properties or related mathematical models.
- **Customizing Parameters:** Adjust the parameters in the script according to your needs.



# Example Prompts
To get started, feel free to ask me a question or provide some information about an issue you are facing. Here are few examples of how you can & Commands
- 1."Create a python script of simulation of a barbell-shaped cylinder to calculate its scattering properties. The cylinder should have spherical end caps with a larger radius than the cylinder itself. Specify the radius of the cylinder, the radius of the spherical caps, and the length of the cylinder as input parameters. The simulation should output the scattering properties of this structure based on these geometric details."
- 2."I received an error stating 'Invalid cylinder radius' when running the barbell.py script. Can you help me understand why this error occurs and how to fix it"
- 3."Generate the scattering properties of a barbell-shaped cylinder with a radius of 2 units for the cylinder, 3 units for the spherical end caps, and a cylinder length of 10 units."
